This repo stores a multilanguage text corpus for the Web verison of IGDIG.

## Notice:
We have put this project on [**Weblate**](https://translate.igdig.com/projects/igdig/igdigcom/), an open source translation platform that is easier to use for translation purpose.

And, generally, this repo will not accept direct pull requests any more.

Usually, IGDIG team staff handle submitions on [**Weblate**](https://translate.igdig.com/projects/igdig/igdigcom/) and use GitHub just as a place to store code. Therefore it would be wonderful if you kindly submit your work on [**Weblate**](https://translate.igdig.com/projects/igdig/igdigcom/).
